Description: Extension of 'dplyr's functionality which allows to create new
    columns in 'dplyr::mutate()' and 'dplyr::summarise()' by applying a function
    (or a set of functions) to a vector using a syntax similar to 'dplyr::across()'.
    Helper functions are provided to easily select and evaluate strings. Refer
    to the documentation for examples and more information.
