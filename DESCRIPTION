Description: This package extends 'dplyr's functionality so that columns can be
    created in 'mutate' and 'summarise' calls by applying a function (or a set of
    functions) to a character vector using a syntax similar to the existing 'across'
    function. Helper functions are provided to easily select and evaluate strings. Refer to
    the documentation for examples and more information.
