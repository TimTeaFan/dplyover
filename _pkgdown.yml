- title: over-across family
  desc: |
    The functions in the *over-apply* function family create columns by applying
    one or several functions to:
    `over()` a vector (list or atomic vector);
    `over2()` two vectors of the same length (pairwise)
    `over2x()` two vectors of the same length (nested)
    `across2()` two sets of columns (pairwise)
    `across2x()` two sets of columns (nested)
    `crossover()` a set of columns and a vector (nested)

- title: selection helpers
  desc: >
    dplyover provides two three of selection helpers which are intended for use
    in all functions that accept a vector as argument (that is `over()` and
    `crossover()` as well as their variants). 1. Helpers which select string
    parts of the column names (of the underyling data): `cut_names()` removes a
    specified pattern; `extract_names()` extracts a specified pattern.
    2. Helpers which select values of a variable: `dist_values()` returns all
    distinct values; `seq_range()` returns the sequence between the range of a
    variable. 3. A helper function that takes a glue specifcation as input, and
    evaluates the final argument string as name in the caller environment.

- title: data

    dplyyover comes with a randomly generated data from a customer satisfaction
    survey using CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) for a contract-based
    product. The data set comes in two versions: recoded and raw.
